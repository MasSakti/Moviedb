## About
An Android Developer is a Software Developer who specializes in designing applications for the Android marketplace. 
This means most of an Android Developerâ€™s job revolves around creating the apps we use on our smartphones and tablets. 
Android Developers can either work in-house for a large organization, or they can be employed by an App Development agency.
